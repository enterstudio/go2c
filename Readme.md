# Example of interfacing between Go and C programs.

How Go functions can be exported and used via the C API.

`make` will compile the Go code, generate the header, lib and object files,
and compile the C example

`make run` will run both the C and Perl examples.

For the Perl example Inline::C module is needed

Still WIP
